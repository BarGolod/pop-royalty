        <div class="defintion">
          How do you define it?<br />Is it determined by the number of years in
          the industry?<br />Is it based on chart placements, record sales,
          cultural impact, or notoriety for their actions?<br />Is it about
          being the most artistic, unique, having the best voice, or the most
          exceptional lyrics?<br />Is it related to budget or production value,
          or is it simply having a talented team and a reputable record label
          behind them?<br />How can we compare generations that had vinyl
          records and radio to the streaming era?<br />Making into this list is
          a blend of subjective opinions and a track record of success over the
          years.<br />Each decade has chosen 10 stars who reached their prime
          during that specific decade, even though most careers continued
          beyond.<br />Let's break down what defines a
